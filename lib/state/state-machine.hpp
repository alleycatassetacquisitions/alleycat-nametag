/*
 * StateMachine can be thought of as the base class for "apps" on the PDN.
 * The class holds a stateMap, which is a vector of states, and moves through
 * those states based off of each state's StateTransitions.
 *
 * As a state machine moves through the stateMap, it invokes each state's lifecycle
 * methods in order.
 *
 * The basic control flow for a StateMachine looks like this:
 *
 * StateMachine initialized -> populates the state map, sets the current state and invokes
 * the first state's onStateMounted method.
 *
 * stateMachine.loop() must be invoked within the arduino loop function, which means
 * the statemachine loop will be invoked on every tick of the microcontroller.
 * (this hooks into the device loop())
 *
 *
 * From there, the current state's onStateLoop function is invoked.
 * At the end of each state's loop, state transitions are checked.
 *
 * If the condition for any of a state's transitions are met, the state machine
 * then invokes a transition to the new state.
 *
 * The current state is dismounted through a call to onStateDismounted.
 * Then, the current state is set to the state attached to the StateTransition.
 *
 * The new state's onStateMounted call is then invoked, at which point we return to
 * our loop function and continue with the new state's onStateLoop function.
